# ReadME Generator

## Description
I wanted to make it easier to make readme files for my projects so I created a program to properly format and remind me what items needs to go in the readme document. 

## Installation
Run npm i and then npm start

## Usage
Generating simple readme documents for projects.

## Contributing
Anyone having ideas to improve the project should post their ideas and submissions to the github repo.

## Tests
When you run npm start answer the questions and it will create a basic readme in the project folder.
